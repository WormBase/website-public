[GENES]
key = Curated Genes
citation = Protein-coding gene structures result from the integration of a variety 
           of prediction methods and data sources followed by manual review and revison 
           by WormBase curators. tRNAs are predicted by tRNAscan, and other non-coding 
           RNA transcripts are taken from a variety of literature sources. 
           The purple and blue colors indicate transcripts on the forward and 
           reverse strands respectively. If sufficient room is available between 
           features, gene models end with a triangle; if not a small arrow is used. 
           Grey areas represent 5' and 3' UTRs of protein-coding transcripts, assigned  
           automatically using the extents of overlapping ESTs and full-length cDNAs. The 
           UTR predictions have not been reviewed by WormBase curators, and some are 
           known to contain artifacts.

[VARIATIONS_POLYMORPHISMS]
citations =     This track shows single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs).
               In this track, the molecular nature of the polymorphism is indicated by
               its glyph: Boxes are deletions; triangles are insertions; point mutations
               and substitutions are diamonds. Color reflects the source strain: polymorphisms 
	       found in CB4858 (Pasadena) are shown in blue; those found in CB4856 (Hawaii) in yellow,	
	       and all others in white.
