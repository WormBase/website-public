I don\'t mind to answer questions through forums, emails, PMs, etc, but for me it\'s a lot easier to see what is the problem and find the solution when I can talk about it using a microphone. And also I think this is a lot faster and more effective way to sort problems.<p>
<p>I am connected around 10 hours every day using the programs <strong>"Skype"</strong>, <strong>"YIM"</strong> (Yahoo Messenger) and <strong>"MSN"</strong> (Live Messenger). I have also created a system in my server to write down what I am doing at every moment and have added a piece of code to the mod to read that info from my server (the piece you can see just next to these lines) so you can see if I am available or not.</p>
<p>If you have installed as well the program Skype, the process cannot be any easier. All you have to do is wait until I am available and click on the "Online" button. That will open automatically the program Skype in your computer and will start a conversation between us.</p>
<p>If you prefer to use YIM or MSN instead of Skype or if you haven\'t got a microphone, the button is not going to work automatically. In that case the button is going to be useful for you only to know if I am available or not, but to contact me you will need to add me first inside the program you use, like any other of your contacts. My ID inside those 3 programs is this one:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Skype and YIM : <strong>snoopy_virtual_studio</strong></li>
	<li>MSN : <strong>snoopy_virtual_studio@hotmail.com</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>NOTICE:</strong> Don\'t use my hotmail address to send me emails, as I almost never read them. If you need to send me an email use this other address instead: <a href="mailto:info@snoopyvirtualstudio.com">info@snoopyvirtualstudio.com</a></p>
<p><strong>WARNING:</strong> There are a lot of languages in the world I can understand even if it\'s only a little of it, but the only 2 I am really fluent with are English and Spanish. If you cannot speak any of those 2 languages you can call me if you want, but I cannot promise we will be able to understand each other.</p>
<p><strong>ANOTHER WARNING:</strong> Before you start asking questions it would be a good idea to do a quick search using the links you can see further down, to see if somebody else have already had the same problem and it has already been sorted. The main reason why I have created this "Online Help" system is to save time and it would make no sense at all if I end up answering hundreds of times the same questions every day.</p>';
$txt['httpBL_help_1_title'] = 'Other ways to ask for help';
$txt['httpBL_help_1_body'] = '<p>Of course, even if I personally prefer the "Online Help" system, there will be times when it will be impossible to use it. Either because you live too far away from me and we are never online at the same time, or because you don\'t like the instant messenger programs, or because you need help when I am too busy with other projects and cannot be connected, or whatever other reason. In any of these cases you can find and/or ask for help using a lot of different ways:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong><a href="http://www.snoopyvirtualstudio.com/tutoriales/index.php?estudio=httpBL_2;language=english" target="_blank">Tutorial explaining how the mod works, how to install it and how to configure it properly</a></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Every time I update the mod I try to update the tutorial as well, but of course that depends on the amount of free time I have at any given moment, so sometimes you will see the tutorial a little out of date with the actual performance of the mod. But I hope some day I will find time to update the tutorial properly. Besides I have been planing to add to the tutorial also a <strong>"FAQ"</strong> section with all the questions that people have been asking me over time and to add also some other useful sections. It won\'t be a bad idea to check from time to time if there is something new there.</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong><a href="http://www.simplemachines.org/community/index.php?topic=366399.0" target="_blank">Official mod\'s support thread</a></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Full of very interesting questions and answers about the mod and other topics related to the protection against spammers. It is also the place to report any bugs you may find in the mod or to ask for new features you would like to see in future versions.</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong><a href="http://www.snoopyvirtualstudio.com/foro/index.php?board=30.0;language=english" target="_blank">The section dedicated to this mod inside my personal forum</a></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>My personal forum is dedicated to sort any kind of problems anybody may have inside a lot of different IT fields. Inside it there is a section dedicated to mod httpBL, where you can see (among other things) how you can install as well this mod on other web sites made with PHP but without SMF.</p>';
$txt['httpBL_help_2_title'] = 'How you can help us';
$txt['httpBL_help_2_body'] = '<p>This mod is <strong>"Free Source"</strong> and that means it\'s a team work where all of us help each other. So it\'s not only about others solving your problems, but you should also ask yourself in what ways you can help all the people who use it. Depending on your skills and free time, the different ways you can help are these ones:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Donations</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>If this mod have helped you out, donations are a great way of saying "Thanks!". Furthermore, the months when donations reach an acceptable level, I don\'t have to spend so many hours looking for customers to make other types of work and I can devote more time to what really matters: The various free software projects which I collaborate with.</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Reporting bugs</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Whenever you see that the mod is behaving in a way that is not expected, you should report the bug in the appropriate forum. If you also have enough programming knowledge to find where is the failure and propose a solution, the better, but even if you have no idea of where the fault is, the mere fact of reporting it is helpful, because it will allow someone with more experience to know that the bug exists and to dedicate some time to solve it, which will make the mod work even better.</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Answering questions in the forum</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>If you\'ve been using this mod for some time and have some practice with it, you\'ll see at times that someone asks a question in the forum that you know the answer. If you answer that question it will save me some time and allow me to concentrate on more important problems.</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Helping with the development of this mod</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>If you have enough knowledge of PHP and some free time you can help solving mod bugs and/or developing future versions. To do this I have opened a <strong><a href="http://www.snoopyvirtualstudio.com/foro/index.php?board=36.0;language=english" target="_blank">sub-forum inside my personal forum</a></strong> where you are welcome if you are interested in the subject.</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>More</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Any other ideas you can think of to help us is welcome.</p>';
$txt['httpBL_about_title'] = 'About MOD httpBL';
$txt['httpBL_about_body'] = '<p>Mod httpBL was started in 2009 by me, J. C. Redondo "Snoopy", from <strong><a href="http://www.snoopyvirtualstudio.com/index.php?language=english" target="_blank">Snoopy Virtual Studio</a></strong>, based on ideas from Project Honey Pot message board, mainly <strong><a href="http://www.projecthoneypot.org/board/read.php?f=10&i=1&t=1" target="_blank">from this thread</a></strong> and also from the <strong><a href="http://drupal.org/project/httpBL" target="_blank">Drupal http:BL MOD made by praseodym</a></strong>.</p>
<p>Of course, Drupal code is very different from SMF code, so since the beginning I had to change it a lot. Furthermore, since I started it, I\'ve been modifying it a lot more and adding new features, as I have been having new ideas or they have been suggested to me by other people in SMF forum, so in the current version there is very little left from the original work, but all this would not have been possible without that initial work.</p>
<p>Since version 2.4 of October 2010, this mod also uses the functions created by <strong>Marcin Krol</strong> and modified by <strong><a href="http://www.simplemachines.org/community/index.php?action=profile;u=154415" target="_blank">X3mE</a></strong> in his mod <strong><a href="http://www.simplemachines.org/community/index.php?action=profile;u=154415" target="_blank">OS & Browser Detection</a></strong> to detect the Operating System and Browser of potential spammers.</p>
<p>This program, as most of my work, is free software (at least the parts I have done). You may redistribute it and/or modify it for your own projects anyway you want. Just mention where you got it from, to give me the credit I deserve for my efforts. Anyway if you are going to make any money with it, I will be very grateful if you consider donating me a small percentage of your profit.</p>';

I don\'t mind to answer questions through forums, emails, PMs, etc, but for me it\'s a lot easier to see what is the problem and find the solution when I can talk about it using a microphone. And also I think this is a lot faster and more effective way to sort problems.<p>
<p>I am connected around 10 hours every day using the programs <strong>"Skype"</strong>, <strong>"YIM"</strong> (Yahoo Messenger) and <strong>"MSN"</strong> (Live Messenger). I have also created a system in my server to write down what I am doing at every moment and have added a piece of code to the mod to read that info from my server (the piece you can see just next to these lines) so you can see if I am available or not.</p>
<p>If you have installed as well the program Skype, the process cannot be any easier. All you have to do is wait until I am available and click on the "Online" button. That will open automatically the program Skype in your computer and will start a conversation between us.</p>
<p>If you prefer to use YIM or MSN instead of Skype or if you haven\'t got a microphone, the button is not going to work automatically. In that case the button is going to be useful for you only to know if I am available or not, but to contact me you will need to add me first inside the program you use, like any other of your contacts. My ID inside those 3 programs is this one:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Skype and YIM : <strong>snoopy_virtual_studio</strong></li>
	<li>MSN : <strong>snoopy_virtual_studio@hotmail.com</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>NOTICE:</strong> Don\'t use my hotmail address to send me emails, as I almost never read them. If you need to send me an email use this other address instead: <a href="mailto:info@snoopyvirtualstudio.com">info@snoopyvirtualstudio.com</a></p>
<p><strong>WARNING:</strong> There are a lot of languages in the world I can understand even if it\'s only a little of it, but the only 2 I am really fluent with are English and Spanish. If you cannot speak any of those 2 languages you can call me if you want, but I cannot promise we will be able to understand each other.</p>
<p><strong>ANOTHER WARNING:</strong> Before you start asking questions it would be a good idea to do a quick search using the links you can see further down, to see if somebody else have already had the same problem and it has already been sorted. The main reason why I have created this "Online Help" system is to save time and it would make no sense at all if I end up answering hundreds of times the same questions every day.</p>';

$txt['httpBL_help_1_body'] = '<p>Of course, even if I personally prefer the "Online Help" system, there will be times when it will be impossible to use it. Either because you live too far away from me and we are never online at the same time, or because you don\'t like the instant messenger programs, or because you need help when I am too busy with other projects and cannot be connected, or whatever other reason. In any of these cases you can find and/or ask for help using a lot of different ways:</p>

<p>Every time I update the mod I try to update the tutorial as well, but of course that depends on the amount of free time I have at any given moment, so sometimes you will see the tutorial a little out of date with the actual performance of the mod. But I hope some day I will find time to update the tutorial properly. Besides I have been planing to add to the tutorial also a <strong>"FAQ"</strong> section with all the questions that people have been asking me over time and to add also some other useful sections. It won\'t be a bad idea to check from time to time if there is something new there.</p>

$txt['httpBL_help_2_body'] = '<p>This mod is <strong>"Free Source"</strong> and that means it\'s a team work where all of us help each other. So it\'s not only about others solving your problems, but you should also ask yourself in what ways you can help all the people who use it. Depending on your skills and free time, the different ways you can help are these ones:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Donations</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>If this mod have helped you out, donations are a great way of saying "Thanks!". Furthermore, the months when donations reach an acceptable level, I don\'t have to spend so many hours looking for customers to make other types of work and I can devote more time to what really matters: The various free software projects which I collaborate with.</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Reporting bugs</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Whenever you see that the mod is behaving in a way that is not expected, you should report the bug in the appropriate forum. If you also have enough programming knowledge to find where is the failure and propose a solution, the better, but even if you have no idea of where the fault is, the mere fact of reporting it is helpful, because it will allow someone with more experience to know that the bug exists and to dedicate some time to solve it, which will make the mod work even better.</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Answering questions in the forum</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>If you\'ve been using this mod for some time and have some practice with it, you\'ll see at times that someone asks a question in the forum that you know the answer. If you answer that question it will save me some time and allow me to concentrate on more important problems.</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Helping with the development of this mod</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>If you have enough knowledge of PHP and some free time you can help solving mod bugs and/or developing future versions. To do this I have opened a <strong><a href="http://www.snoopyvirtualstudio.com/foro/index.php?board=36.0;language=english" target="_blank">sub-forum inside my personal forum</a></strong> where you are welcome if you are interested in the subject.</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>More</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Any other ideas you can think of to help us is welcome.</p>';
$txt['httpBL_about_title'] = 'About MOD httpBL';
$txt['httpBL_about_body'] = '<p>Mod httpBL was started in 2009 by me, J. C. Redondo "Snoopy", from <strong><a href="http://www.snoopyvirtualstudio.com/index.php?language=english" target="_blank">Snoopy Virtual Studio</a></strong>, based on ideas from Project Honey Pot message board, mainly <strong><a href="http://www.projecthoneypot.org/board/read.php?f=10&i=1&t=1" target="_blank">from this thread</a></strong> and also from the <strong><a href="http://drupal.org/project/httpBL" target="_blank">Drupal http:BL MOD made by praseodym</a></strong>.</p>
<p>Of course, Drupal code is very different from SMF code, so since the beginning I had to change it a lot. Furthermore, since I started it, I\'ve been modifying it a lot more and adding new features, as I have been having new ideas or they have been suggested to me by other people in SMF forum, so in the current version there is very little left from the original work, but all this would not have been possible without that initial work.</p>
<p>Since version 2.4 of October 2010, this mod also uses the functions created by <strong>Marcin Krol</strong> and modified by <strong><a href="http://www.simplemachines.org/community/index.php?action=profile;u=154415" target="_blank">X3mE</a></strong> in his mod <strong><a href="http://www.simplemachines.org/community/index.php?action=profile;u=154415" target="_blank">OS & Browser Detection</a></strong> to detect the Operating System and Browser of potential spammers.</p>
<p>This program, as most of my work, is free software (at least the parts I have done). You may redistribute it and/or modify it for your own projects anyway you want. Just mention where you got it from, to give me the credit I deserve for my efforts. Anyway if you are going to make any money with it, I will be very grateful if you consider donating me a small percentage of your profit.</p>';

$txt['httpBL_online_body'] = '<p>Hay varias formas que puedes usar para pedir ayuda, pero la mejor de todas es preguntarme directamente cualquier duda que tengas, para que podamos hablar sobre ella y resolverla sin necesidad de perder el tiempo. Nunca me ha importado que me planteen dudas en algún foro o a través de emails, mensajes privados, etc, pero desde luego me resulta mucho más fácil entender un problema y encontrar una solución cuando puedo hablar directamente usando un micrófono. Y además me parece un sistema mucho más rápido y efectivo de resolver problemas.<p>
<p>Para ello tengo abiertos unas 10 horas diarias los programas <strong>"Skype"</strong>, <strong>"YIM"</strong> (Yahoo Messenger) y <strong>"MSN"</strong> (Live Messenger). Además he creado un sistema en mi servidor donde indico en todo momento que es lo que estoy haciendo y he añadido al mod un trozo de código que lee esa información de mi servidor (lo que puedes ver justo al lado de estas líneas) para que todos vosotros podáis saber cuando estoy disponible y cuando no.</p>
<p>En caso de que tú tengas también instalado el programa Skype, el proceso no puede ser más sencillo. No tienes más que esperar a que yo esté disponible y pulsar el botón que dice "Conectado". Eso hará que, de forma automática, se te abra en tu ordenador el Skype y nos pongamos a hablar el uno con el otro.</p>
<p>Si en vez de Skype prefieres usar alguno de los otros 2 programas o en caso de que no tengas micrófono, ese botón no funcionará de forma automática. En este caso el botón solo te servirá como información para saber si estoy disponible o no, pero para poder contactar conmigo necesitarás añadirme primero dentro del programa que uses, como a cualquier otro de tus contactos. Mi ID en estos 3 programas es la siguiente:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Skype y YIM : <strong>snoopy_virtual_studio</strong></li>
	<li>MSN : <strong>snoopy_virtual_studio@hotmail.com</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>NOTA:</strong> No uses mi dirección de hotmail para mandarme emails, que no suelo leerlos nunca. En caso de que quieras mandarme un email usa esta otra dirección: <a href="mailto:info@snoopyvirtualstudio.com">info@snoopyvirtualstudio.com</a></p>
<p><strong>AVISO:</strong> Aunque hay muchos idiomas del mundo que puedo entender en mayor o menor grado, los únicos que realmente se me dan bien son Inglés y Español. Si no hablas ninguno de estos 2 idiomas puedes intentar llamarme si quieres, pero no puedo prometerte que logremos entendernos.</p>
<p><strong>OTRO AVISO:</strong> Antes de plantear ninguna duda es siempre recomendable hacer una búsqueda rápida en los enlaces que especifico más abajo, para ver si alguien ha tenido ya esa misma duda y ha sido ya resuelta. La principal razón por la que he creado este sistema de "Ayuda en línea" es para ahorrar tiempo y no tendría ningún sentido que al final me pasara el día entero contestando cientos de veces las mismas preguntas.</p>';

Ya sea porque vivas en una zona del mundo que haga que nuestros horarios nunca coincidan, porque no te guste usar ningún programa de mensajería instantánea, porque necesites ayuda en una época en la que yo no pueda estar conectado o por la razón que sea. Para cualquiera de estos casos hay de todas formas otros muchos sistemas para buscar y/o pedir ayuda:</p>

<p>Cada vez que actualizo algo en el mod procuro actualizarlo también en el tutorial, aunque esto normalmente depende de la cantidad de tiempo libre que tenga en cada momento, por lo que a veces veréis que el tutorial está algo desfasado con el funcionamiento real del mod. Sin embargo espero que poco a poco pueda acabar por ponerlo al día. Además tengo pensado añadirle una sección de <strong>"Preguntas Frecuentes"</strong> con todas las preguntas que la gente ha ido haciéndome a lo largo del tiempo y algunas otras secciones útiles. No sería mala idea que comprobaras de vez en cuando si hay ahí algo nuevo.</p>

$txt['httpBL_help_2_body'] = '<p>Este mod es <strong>"Software Libre"</strong> lo que significa que es un trabajo en equipo donde todos nos ayudamos unos a otros. Por lo tanto no solo se trata de que los demás te resolvamos tus problemas, sino que además deberías de plantearte de que formas puedes ayudar tú a todos los que lo usamos. Dependiendo de tus conocimientos y el tiempo libre del que dispongas, las diferentes formas en que puedes ayudar son las siguientes:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Donaciones</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Si este mod te ha ayudado en algo, hacer una donación es una buena manera de decir "¡Gracias!". Además, los meses en que las donaciones alcanzan un nivel aceptable, no tengo que pasarme tantas horas buscando clientes para hacer otros tipos de trabajos y puedo dedicar mucho más tiempo a lo que realmente importa: Los diferentes proyectos de software libre en los que colaboro.</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Reportar fallos</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Cada vez que veas que el mod se comporta de una forma que no sea la esperada, deberías informar del fallo en el foro correspondiente. Si además tienes los suficientes conocimientos de programación como para encontrar donde está el fallo y proponer una solución, mejor que mejor, pero incluso aunque no tengas ni idea de donde está el fallo, el solo hecho de informar del mismo ya es una ayuda, pues permite que alguien con más experiencia sepa que el fallo existe y se dedique a solucionarlo, lo que hace que el mod funcione cada vez mejor.</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Contestar preguntas de otros en el foro</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Si ya llevas un tiempo usando el mod y tienes algo de práctica con él, verás a veces que alguien hace una pregunta en el foro de la que tú sabes la respuesta. Si contestas tú a esa pregunta me ahorrarás tiempo a mi y me permitirás poder concentrarme en problemas más importantes.</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Ayudar con el desarrollo del mod</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Si tienes suficientes conocimientos de PHP y algo de tiempo libre puedes colaborar solucionando fallos del mod y/o desarrollando futuras versiones del mismo. Para ello he abierto un <strong><a href="http://www.snoopyvirtualstudio.com/foro/index.php?board=36.0" target="_blank">sub-foro dentro de mi foro personal</a></strong> donde estás invitado si te interesa el tema.</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Más</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Cualquier otra idea que se te ocurra para ayudarnos es bienvenida.</p>';
$txt['httpBL_about_title'] = 'Acerca del MOD httpBL';
$txt['httpBL_about_body'] = '<p>El mod httpBL fue iniciado en 2009 por mi, J. C. Redondo "Snoopy", de <strong><a href="http://www.snoopyvirtualstudio.com/" target="_blank">Snoopy Virtual Studio</a></strong>, basándome en ideas tomadas del foro de Project Honey Pot, principalmente <strong><a href="http://www.projecthoneypot.org/board/read.php?f=10&i=1&t=1" target="_blank">de este hilo</a></strong> y en el <strong><a href="http://drupal.org/project/httpBL" target="_blank">MOD http:BL hecho por praseodym para Drupal</a></strong>.</p>
<p>Por supuesto, el código de Drupal es muy diferente del de SMF, por lo que ya desde el principio tuve que modificarlo mucho. Además, desde que lo inicié, he ido modificándolo mucho más y añadiendo nuevas funciones, según se me han ido ocurriendo nuevas ideas o me las han ido sugiriendo otra gente del foro de SMF, por lo que en la versión actual queda muy poco del trabajo original en el que me basé, pero todo esto no habría sido posible sin ese trabajo inicial.</p>
<p>Desde la versión 2.4 de Octubre de 2010, este mod utiliza también las funciones creadas por <strong>Marcin Krol</strong> y modificadas por <strong><a href="http://www.simplemachines.org/community/index.php?action=profile;u=154415" target="_blank">X3mE</a></strong> en su mod <strong><a href="http://www.simplemachines.org/community/index.php?action=profile;u=154415" target="_blank">OS & Browser Detection</a></strong> para poder detectar el Sistema Operativo y el Navegador de los posibles spammers.</p>
<p>Este programa, como la mayoría de mi trabajo, es software libre (al menos las partes que he hecho yo). Puedes redistribuirlo y/o modificarlo para tus propios proyectos de la forma que quieras. Simplemente menciona de dónde sacaste la idea, para concederme el crédito que merezco por mis esfuerzos. De todos modos, si vas a ganar dinero con él, te estaría muy agradecido si consideraras donarme un pequeño porcentaje de tus ganancias.</p>';

$txt['httpBL_online_body'] = '<p>Hay varias formas que puedes usar para pedir ayuda, pero la mejor de todas es preguntarme directamente cualquier duda que tengas, para que podamos hablar sobre ella y resolverla sin necesidad de perder el tiempo. Nunca me ha importado que me planteen dudas en algún foro o a través de emails, mensajes privados, etc, pero desde luego me resulta mucho más fácil entender un problema y encontrar una solución cuando puedo hablar directamente usando un micrófono. Y además me parece un sistema mucho más rápido y efectivo de resolver problemas.<p>
<p>Para ello tengo abiertos unas 10 horas diarias los programas <strong>"Skype"</strong>, <strong>"YIM"</strong> (Yahoo Messenger) y <strong>"MSN"</strong> (Live Messenger). Además he creado un sistema en mi servidor donde indico en todo momento que es lo que estoy haciendo y he añadido al mod un trozo de código que lee esa información de mi servidor (lo que puedes ver justo al lado de estas líneas) para que todos vosotros podáis saber cuando estoy disponible y cuando no.</p>
<p>En caso de que tú tengas también instalado el programa Skype, el proceso no puede ser más sencillo. No tienes más que esperar a que yo esté disponible y pulsar el botón que dice "Conectado". Eso hará que, de forma automática, se te abra en tu ordenador el Skype y nos pongamos a hablar el uno con el otro.</p>
<p>Si en vez de Skype prefieres usar alguno de los otros 2 programas o en caso de que no tengas micrófono, ese botón no funcionará de forma automática. En este caso el botón solo te servirá como información para saber si estoy disponible o no, pero para poder contactar conmigo necesitarás añadirme primero dentro del programa que uses, como a cualquier otro de tus contactos. Mi ID en estos 3 programas es la siguiente:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Skype y YIM : <strong>snoopy_virtual_studio</strong></li>
	<li>MSN : <strong>snoopy_virtual_studio@hotmail.com</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>NOTA:</strong> No uses mi dirección de hotmail para mandarme emails, que no suelo leerlos nunca. En caso de que quieras mandarme un email usa esta otra dirección: <a href="mailto:info@snoopyvirtualstudio.com">info@snoopyvirtualstudio.com</a></p>
<p><strong>AVISO:</strong> Aunque hay muchos idiomas del mundo que puedo entender en mayor o menor grado, los únicos que realmente se me dan bien son Inglés y Español. Si no hablas ninguno de estos 2 idiomas puedes intentar llamarme si quieres, pero no puedo prometerte que logremos entendernos.</p>
<p><strong>OTRO AVISO:</strong> Antes de plantear ninguna duda es siempre recomendable hacer una búsqueda rápida en los enlaces que especifico más abajo, para ver si alguien ha tenido ya esa misma duda y ha sido ya resuelta. La principal razón por la que he creado este sistema de "Ayuda en línea" es para ahorrar tiempo y no tendría ningún sentido que al final me pasara el día entero contestando cientos de veces las mismas preguntas.</p>';

Sin embargo espero que poco a poco pueda acabar por ponerlo al día.

Por lo tanto no solo se trata de que los demás te resolvamos tus problemas, sino que además deberías de plantearte de que formas puedes ayudar tú a todos los que lo usamos. Dependiendo de tus conocimientos y el tiempo libre del que dispongas, las diferentes formas en que puedes ayudar son las siguientes:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Donaciones</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Si este mod te ha ayudado en algo, hacer una donación es una buena manera de decir "¡Gracias!". Además, los meses en que las donaciones alcanzan un nivel aceptable, no tengo que pasarme tantas horas buscando clientes para hacer otros tipos de trabajos y puedo dedicar mucho más tiempo a lo que realmente importa: Los diferentes proyectos de software libre en los que colaboro.</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Reportar fallos</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Cada vez que veas que el mod se comporta de una forma que no sea la esperada, deberías informar del fallo en el foro correspondiente. Si además tienes los suficientes conocimientos de programación como para encontrar donde está el fallo y proponer una solución, mejor que mejor, pero incluso aunque no tengas ni idea de donde está el fallo, el solo hecho de informar del mismo ya es una ayuda, pues permite que alguien con más experiencia sepa que el fallo existe y se dedique a solucionarlo, lo que hace que el mod funcione cada vez mejor.</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Contestar preguntas de otros en el foro</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Si ya llevas un tiempo usando el mod y tienes algo de práctica con él, verás a veces que alguien hace una pregunta en el foro de la que tú sabes la respuesta. Si contestas tú a esa pregunta me ahorrarás tiempo a mi y me permitirás poder concentrarme en problemas más importantes.</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Ayudar con el desarrollo del mod</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Si tienes suficientes conocimientos de PHP y algo de tiempo libre puedes colaborar solucionando fallos del mod y/o desarrollando futuras versiones del mismo. Para ello he abierto un <strong><a href="http://www.snoopyvirtualstudio.com/foro/index.php?board=36.0" target="_blank">sub-foro dentro de mi foro personal</a></strong> donde estás invitado si te interesa el tema.</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Más</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Cualquier otra idea que se te ocurra para ayudarnos es bienvenida.</p>';
$txt['httpBL_about_title'] = 'Acerca del MOD httpBL';
$txt['httpBL_about_body'] = '<p>El mod httpBL fue iniciado en 2009 por mi, J. C. Redondo "Snoopy", de <strong><a href="http://www.snoopyvirtualstudio.com/" target="_blank">Snoopy Virtual Studio</a></strong>, basándome en ideas tomadas del foro de Project Honey Pot, principalmente <strong><a href="http://www.projecthoneypot.org/board/read.php?f=10&i=1&t=1" target="_blank">de este hilo</a></strong> y en el <strong><a href="http://drupal.org/project/httpBL" target="_blank">MOD http:BL hecho por praseodym para Drupal</a></strong>.</p>
<p>Por supuesto, el código de Drupal es muy diferente del de SMF, por lo que ya desde el principio tuve que modificarlo mucho. Además, desde que lo inicié, he ido modificándolo mucho más y añadiendo nuevas funciones, según se me han ido ocurriendo nuevas ideas o me las han ido sugiriendo otra gente del foro de SMF, por lo que en la versión actual queda muy poco del trabajo original en el que me basé, pero todo esto no habría sido posible sin ese trabajo inicial.</p>
<p>Desde la versión 2.4 de Octubre de 2010, este mod utiliza también las funciones creadas por <strong>Marcin Krol</strong> y modificadas por <strong><a href="http://www.simplemachines.org/community/index.php?action=profile;u=154415" target="_blank">X3mE</a></strong> en su mod <strong><a href="http://www.simplemachines.org/community/index.php?action=profile;u=154415" target="_blank">OS & Browser Detection</a></strong> para poder detectar el Sistema Operativo y el Navegador de los posibles spammers.</p>
<p>Este programa, como la mayoría de mi trabajo, es software libre (al menos las partes que he hecho yo). Puedes redistribuirlo y/o modificarlo para tus propios proyectos de la forma que quieras. Simplemente menciona de dónde sacaste la idea, para concederme el crédito que merezco por mis esfuerzos. De todos modos, si vas a ganar dinero con él, te estaría muy agradecido si consideraras donarme un pequeño porcentaje de tus ganancias.</p>';
